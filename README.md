# friendfinder

#This is a simplistic version of a dating app. Basically 10 survey questions you answer and you will get matched up with someone else who matches the closest to you.

#As per the instructions, all folders and files have been setup accordingly.

#Setup for this app includes the server file where I put the despendencies, parsing, and routing. I put each of these on seperate files since it's easier for me to follow.
# I also put the friends on a seperate js file to link the results to. I felt it was easier this way

#HTML's include the home page with bootstrap button, and the survey, using a bootdtrap dropdown

#Overall, routing was really hard to get a grasp on, but so far, so good.
